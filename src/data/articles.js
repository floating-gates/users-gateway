            sub_title: "We get tired of surfing web for no value at all!",
            sub_content: "Engineers across disciplines heavily rely on accurate material properties such as density, Young’s modulus and thermal conductivity. While large corporations often pay for access to proprietary databases, smaller companies, researchers, and students are left navigating a jungle of different standards and proprietary normatives.  Open source material databases aim to solve this. By providing free and openly licensed collections of commonly used materials and their key properties, these initiatives lower the entry barrier to reliable engineering design. Instead of spending hours searching through PDF standards or handbooks, engineers can access consistent, structured, and machine-readable data."

           sub_title: "Limitations",
           sub_content: "Such databases do not aim to replace specialized or certified sources where strict compliance is required, but they provide a practical foundation for prototyping, simulation, and early-stage design. For example, datasets for common steels, aluminum alloys, polymers, and composites can be enough for feasibility studies or teaching purposes.The main challenge remains ensuring quality and traceability: open data should include references to the original normative documents and highlight whether a value is typical, guaranteed, or standardized. Collaboration is key—engineers, researchers, and institutions can all contribute to growing a shared resource.  In summary, open source material databases are not about competing with high-end proprietary systems, but about democratizing access to basic, reliable engineering data for everyone."}],

            sub_content:" One of the most promising discoveries in our journey has been realizing how much companies cares about how they are perceived. Hence we sat down and though how we can enable technologically the manufacturing plants in the most outraching way possible, give birth the idea of simply proxying the technology: almost like a remote API, but we decided it was not enougth. Many small and medium enterprises lack the resources to adopt advanced digital solutions directly like API even tough they look simple from a technolgical standoint however, technology can be packaged, simplified, and delivered efficiently using a different distribution mehthods, for us was to deliver a manufacturing hub done and well refined for our manufacturing custiomer. Digitalization like retentred Hubs modernize supply chains and are proofed to have reshaped the relations between cusomter base and providers becoming a decisive competitive advantage. By bridging the gap between innovation and everyday business, a 'B2B2C' model empowers SMEs to thrive in the digital era."}],
