        sub_title: "We get tired of surfing web for no value!",
        sub_content: "Engineers across disciplines heavily rely on accurate material properties such as density, Young’s modulus and thermal conductivity. While large corporations often pay for access to proprietary databases, smaller companies, researchers, and students are left navigating a jungle of different standards and proprietary normatives."

        sub_title: "An accessible and sourced database for common engineering",
        sub_content: "Open source material databases aim to solve this. By providing free and openly licensed collections of commonly used materials and their key properties, these initiatives lower the entry barrier to reliable engineering design. Instead of spending hours searching through PDF standards or handbooks, engineers can access consistent, structured, and machine-readable data."

    {
        sub_title: "Limitations",
        sub_content: "Such databases do not aim to replace specialized or certified sources where strict compliance is required, but they provide a practical foundation for prototyping, simulation, and early-stage design. For example, datasets for common steels, aluminum alloys, polymers, and composites can be enough for feasibility studies or teaching purposes.The main challenge remains ensuring quality and traceability: open data should include references to the original normative documents and highlight whether a value is typical, guaranteed, or standardized."},
    {
        sub_title: "How to make it better",
        sub_content: "Collaboration is key—engineers, researchers, and institutions can all contribute to growing a shared resource.  Open source databases are not about competing with high-end proprietary systems, but about democratizing access to basic, reliable engineering data for everyone."}],
