        sub_content: "One of the most promising discoveries in our journey has been realizing how much companies care about how they are perceived. Hence we sat down and thought about how we can enable technologically the manufacturing plants in the most outreaching way possible, giving birth to the idea of simply proxying the technology: almost like a remote API. However, we realized that APIs alone are not enough for SMEs. Many small and medium enterprises lack the resources to adopt advanced digital solutions directly, even though they may look simple from a technological standpoint. Technology can be packaged, simplified, and delivered efficiently using different distribution methods. For us, it was delivering a manufacturing hub, finely refined for our manufacturing customers. Digitalization, like re-centered hubs, modernizes supply chains and is proven to have reshaped the relationships between customer bases and providers, becoming a decisive competitive advantage. By bridging the gap between innovation and everyday business, a 'B2B2C' model empowers SMEs to thrive in the digital era."}],
